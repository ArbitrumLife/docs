# Why no token?

ETH payouts mean that our game does not have a token. Why?

For several reasons:

* **Lower gas fees**: it is more expensive in gas to transact with tokens, and we have a payout system that involves sending A LOT of payments from a single transaction
* **No price volatility**: We don't want the players to suffer from price volatility of the token, which is almost inevitable
* **Lower entry barrier**: no need to purchase and add a token to play the game - most users already have ETH on Arbitrum
* **More confidence for the users**: a rug is simply impossible
* **Better UX**: wallets show USD equivalent for ETH in transaction confirmation popup, but not for custom tokens
* **Convenience for the users**: ETH payouts save you one step when swapping if you want to cash out
* **We don't need liquidity**: we finance marketing and development from the fees

We believe that for most GameFi projects not having a token would be just a better decision overall.
