# Pricing

#### Buying a new pixel

One **new** **pixel** costs **0.00005** ETH, which is close to **$0.09** at the moment of writing.

New pixels will always be sold at the same price, but the more the world grows, the farther from the center they will be located, and therefore, the less exposure to views they will get. Users always start the game at **(0, 0)** coordinates which is the hottest spot to paint.

#### Repainting your own pixel

Pixel **repaints** are very cheap when you own the pixel - just **1%** of its purchase price. Painting over your own pixel will not increase its price.

#### Repainting someone's pixel

Every resell (repaint by another wallet) multiplies the pixel price by **110%**. **109%** goes to the previous owner, and **1%** to the developer.

These pricing rules serve three purposes:

* ensure that prices for "good" places to draw are well adjusted
* keep users happy when they lose their drawings
* pay for the server costs, development and marketing

10% may look like a small margin, but due to exponential nature the price in fact grows quite fast:

* 0.00012 ETH (\~$0.23) after 10 resells
* 0.00059 ETH (\~$1.07) after 26 resells
* 0.00301 ETH (\~$5.42) after 42 resells
* 0.10242 ETH (\~$184.3) after 80 resells
* 0.68903 ETH (\~$1240) after 100 resells

It stops growing after 255 resells, or \~1795166 ETH (\~$3,231,299,584) - but we sincerely hope no player would be that addicted to the game.

#### Network fees

Network fees are not included in price calculation. They depend on the number of pixels to be painted and network load. Painting a group of pixels located close generally costs less than painting the same number of pixels in different parts of the world.

It is cheaper to paint a lot of pixels at once. The limit is set to 150 per transaction.
