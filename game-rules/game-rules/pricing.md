# Pricing

#### Buying a new pixel

New pixels will always be cheap, but the more the world grows, the farther from the center they will be located, and therefore, the less exposure to the users they will get. Users always start the game at (0, 0) coordinates which is the hottest spot to paint.

#### Repainting your own pixel

Pixel repaints are very cheap when you own the pixel - just 1% of its purchase price. Painting over your own pixel will not increase its price.

#### Repainting someone's pixel

Every repaint by a new user multiplies the pixel price by 110%. 109% goes to the previous owner, and 1% to the developer.

These pricing rules serve two purposes:

* ensure that prices for "good" places to draw are well adjusted
* keep users happy when they lose their drawings - at least they get 109% of the amount spent back

#### Network fees

Network fees are not included in price calculation. They depend on the number of pixels to be painted and network load. Painting a group of pixels located close generally costs less than painting the same number of pixels in different parts of the world.
