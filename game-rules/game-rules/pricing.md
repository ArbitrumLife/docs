# Pricing

#### Buying a new pixel

One **new** **pixel** costs 0.00005 ETH, which is close to $0.10 at the moment of writing.

New pixels will always be sold at the same price, but the more the world grows, the farther from the center they will be located, and therefore, the less exposure to the player views they will get. Users always start the game at (0, 0) coordinates which is the hottest spot to paint.

#### Repainting your own pixel

Pixel **repaints** are very cheap when you own the pixel - just 1% of its purchase price. Painting over your own pixel will not increase its price.

#### Repainting someone's pixel

Every resell (repaint by another wallet) multiplies the pixel price by 106%. 105% goes to the previous owner, and 1% to the developer.

These pricing rules serve three purposes:

* ensure that prices for "good" places to draw are well adjusted
* keep users happy when they lose their drawings - at least they get 105% of the amount spent back
* pay for the server costs, development and marketing

#### Network fees

Network fees are not included in price calculation. They depend on the number of pixels to be painted and network load. Painting a group of pixels located close generally costs less than painting the same number of pixels in different parts of the world.
