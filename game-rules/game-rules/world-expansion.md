# World Expansion

Starting from just **100x100**, the world is expanding on demand to avoid scarcity.

When 80% of all available pixels are painted, world size grows by 100 pixels sideways. Repainting already colored pixels does not affect the world size.

Expansion happens instantly and does not require a page reload.

Maximum size of the world is **2 ^ 16 x 2 ^ 16** (65536x65536).
